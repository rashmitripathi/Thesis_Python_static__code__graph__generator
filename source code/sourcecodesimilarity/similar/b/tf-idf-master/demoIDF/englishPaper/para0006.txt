To start, all the basic adjustments to exposure, contrast, curves, and color temperature are almost all agreed upon in the community of photographers as perfectly fine. These changes all appear natural and normal to the human eye, and thus appear real. These settings can be used to correct for the camera exposure settings (shutter speed, ISO, and aperture) so that the photo is not over or under exposed. These are all changes that would make sense which can be replicated in real life. This makes photography more practical and less time-consuming knowing that if your camera’s exposure was slightly off, that it can easily be fixed in software. Here is an example of a photo I took with minor edits:
