Today, the most popular photo editors are unsurprisingly Adobe Photoshop and its little brother Adobe Lightroom. There are a vase number of other photo editors, but Adobe has a very strong hold on this market. Lightroom is a raw photo editor with organization features, and Photoshop is used for more extensive retouching, masking, faking, etc. Many people have abused the power of these pieces of software in Photography, and now “Photoshop” has become a well-recognized verb. I believe that post-processing a photograph is perfectly fine, and it expresses the feelings, atmosphere, emotion, location, and style that the photographer wanted to capture. However, there is a point where too much editing changes the intent of the photo and is considered not okay.
