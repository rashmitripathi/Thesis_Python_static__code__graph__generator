A photograph is a very popular medium of capturing a moment in time or expressing a certain feeling. In today’s digital world, so many different people have access to cameras, and it becomes hard for a photographer to differentiate himself or herself from the crowd. One of the ways photographers try to make their photos unique is by post-processing (or editing) their photos with photo editing software. Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom have become the staples for photo editing software ever since their release, and they are still the most widely used pieces of photo editing software today. With these powerful tools at the hands of so many photographers, it has helped many photographers refine their photos to their style and to look their best. However, this brings up many issues and ethical questions about the use of post-processing in photography. So, how much editing can be done to a photo to still be considered a photo as opposed to a fake one?
