Photographers will always continue to post-process their photographs whether other people are against it or not. The motivation for a photographer to continue to edit their photos will always be to improve their photo to be the best it can be while distinguishing themselves from the crowd of other photographers. It will always be a blurred line between the aesthetics of a photo and the ethics of editing it. Every photographer wants their image to be aesthetically pleasing, and since there is no technical limit to what can be done to a photo, there will always be an ethical boundary. This will always continue to be an on going issue because people will continue to abuse the power of Photoshop in photography. However, since the amount of post-processing on a photo is all subjective to the photographer, this issue will almost certainly never be resolved. Every photographer is going to see and depict a scene slightly differently, and that is why so many people are drawn to this diverse community to inspire and to be inspired.
