Another popular type of processing film actually is by using different types of film. There are different film strips that can capture slightly different color tones, more saturated colors, or greater contrast; a photographer may pick one of these depending on the style they were going for. There were different types of film including ones for more vibrant colors for landscapes and one for more true to life skin tones for portraits. Although these were not done in post-processing, it still shaped the way photographers edit their photos today. Cross-processing, different photographic film types, and many other things done by film photographers would eventually set the stage for how photos are digitally manipulated.
